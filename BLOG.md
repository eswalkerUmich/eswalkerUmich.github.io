# Projects

## _Professional_
### **Theta Tau Professional Engineering Organization**
**Minimal Spanning Trees** ```(JavaScript, CSS, & HTML)```
- Designed and developed an interactive job crawler page on the [chapter website](https://thetatau-umich.org/#/jobs)
- As a programmer, communicated design decisions between designers and stakeholders to create a clean user-friendly interface

## _University of Michigan Coursework_
### **EECS 281**
**Minimal Spanning Trees** ```(C++)```

Prims & Kruskals

**SQL Databases** ```(C++)```

- Created a relational database with an interface based on a subset of a standard query language using multiple interacting data structures
- Evaluated the runtime and storage tradeoffs for storing and accessing data contained in multiple data structures and wrote a range of algorithms to handle different situations

**Star Wars Priority Queue Implementation** ```(C++)```

- Implemented three different types of priority queues: sorted array, binary heap, and pairing heap with a unique functor to sort objects based on various parameter
- Designed a custom interface with inheritance, basic dynamic polymorphism, and enumerated classes 

**Fastest Path to Treasure** ```(C++)```

- Designed an algorithm to find the fastest route between two locations on a grid with various terrain using two deques 
- Backtraced through the path and outputted it in either a map or list format with various output modes

### **EECS 280**
**Machine Learning** ```(C++)```

- Implemented natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automatically identify the subject of posts from the EECS 280 learning management system where students ask questions in a forum-type format
- Utilized recursion, binary search trees, templates, comparators, and implemented a map data structure

**Web Server for an Office Hours Queue** ```(C++)```

- Used C++ to create a REST API to read requests and write responses in simplified HTTP that produced a working web application accessible through any browser
- Wrote a templated and object-oriented program structure, with a class representing a doubly-linked list which was used as a queue to hold requests

**Euchre** ```(C++)```

- Built Euchre, a popular Michigan  card game, through object-oriented programming with classes for the game's cards, pack, and deck
- Implemented a Player Factory with 2 derived classes, taking into account both human and computer players

**Computer Vision** ```(C++)``` 

- Wrote a seam carving algorithm, which is a technique for content-aware resizing of images (sometimes known as “retargeting”)
- Produced a program that could resize images in a way that changes the aspect ratio but does not distort the image
