- Presented my work at the World Youth Wildlife Summit by African Conservation Trust and Project Rhino to bring together youth delegates aged 15-18 years and empower them to become ambassadors for conservation and to make a stand against wildlife crime


# Projects

## _Professional_
### **Theta Tau Professional Engineering Organization**
**Minimal Spanning Trees** ```JavaScript, CSS, & HTML```
- Designed and developed an interactive job crawler page on the [chapter website](https://thetatau-umich.org/#/jobs)
- As a programmer, communicated design decisions between designers and stakeholders to create a clean user-friendly interface

## _University of Michigan Coursework_
### **EECS 281**
**Minimal Spanning Trees** ```C++```
- Implement multiple MST algorithms and determined whether Prim’s or Kruskal’s is more efficient for a particular scenario
- Developed a fast and effective bounding algorithm
- Researched and created a combination of various heuristic approaches to achieving a nearly-optimal solution as fast as possible

**SQL Databases** ```C++```
- Created a relational database with an interface based on a subset of a standard query language using multiple interacting data structures
- Evaluated the runtime and storage tradeoffs for storing and accessing data contained in multiple data structures and wrote a range of algorithms to handle different situations

**Star Wars Priority Queue Implementation** ```C++```

- Implemented three different types of priority queues: sorted array, binary heap, and pairing heap with a unique functor to sort objects based on various parameter
- Designed a custom interface with inheritance, basic dynamic polymorphism, and enumerated classes 

**Fastest Path to Treasure** ```C++```

- Designed an algorithm to find the fastest route between two locations on a grid with various terrain using two deques 
- Backtraced through the path and outputted it in either a map or list format with various output modes

### **EECS 280**
**Machine Learning** ```C++```
- Implemented natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automatically identify the subject of posts from the EECS 280 learning management system where students ask questions in a forum-type format
- Utilized recursion, binary search trees, templates, comparators, and implemented a map data structure

**Web Server for an Office Hours Queue** ```C++```
- Used C++ to create a REST API to read requests and write responses in simplified HTTP that produced a working web application accessible through any browser
- Wrote a templated and object-oriented program structure, with a class representing a doubly-linked list which was used as a queue to hold requests

**Euchre** ```C++```
- Built Euchre, a popular Michigan  card game, through object-oriented programming with classes for the game's cards, pack, and deck
- Implemented a Player Factory with 2 derived classes, taking into account both human and computer players

**Computer Vision** ```C++```
- Wrote a seam carving algorithm, which is a technique for content-aware resizing of images (sometimes known as “retargeting”)
- Produced a program that could resize images in a way that changes the aspect ratio but does not distort the image

### **EECS 370**
**Assembler, Simulator, and Assembly-Language Multiplication** ```C```
- Wrote a program which takes as input an LC2K assembly file and outputs its correct machine code representation into a machine code file
- Created a simulator of the LC2K ISA, by taking an assembly-language program and translating it into machine language
- Created an assembly-language program to multiply two numbers

**Global Assembler, Linker, and Assembly-Language Recursive Function** ```C```
- Created an assembler that allows for external references (i.e references to labels that are NOT defined locally) and allow for a program called the linker to resolve those undefined external references
- Developed a linker program that concatenated all text and data segments within each object file, creating one unified executable in machine code
- Wrote an assembly-language function to double-recursively compute combination(n,r)

**Pipelined Simulator** ```C```
- Wrote a cycle-accurate behavioral simulator for a pipelined implementation of the LC-2K, complete with data forwarding and branch prediction
- Used a clocking scheme mimicking real-life processors (e.g., register file and memory writes require the data to be present for the whole cycle)

**Cache Simulator** ```C```
- Simulated a CPU cache (unified instruction/data) and integrate the cache into a behavioral simulator
- Implemented a flexible cache simulator that can simulate a variety of cache configurations
