Hi! My name is Emily Walker, and I am currently a sophomore in the University of Michigan College of Engineering pursuing a Bachelor of Science and Engineering in Computer Science through the Engineering Global Leadership (EGL) Honors Program alongside the International Minor for Engineers. As founder of Kids Against Animal Poaching, I have a demonstrated history of working in the non-profit organization management industry. With my academics and interests in programming and background in entrepreneurship and management, I plan to pursue a career in software development, product management, or technology consulting. Welcome to my website!
